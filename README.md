'Distributed Online Learning of Event Definitions' is an online rule learning system, 
implemented in Scala by using the akka-actors library 
in order to learn rule definitions that can be used in Complex Event Definitions systems.

It was the primary scope of a diploma thesis, and you can find the code in this repo!

This work integrates the work in:
https://github.com/nkatzz/OLED
where the original monolithic system was originally presented.
